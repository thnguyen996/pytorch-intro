# Deep Learning with PyTorch

These exercies are modified versions of Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson.
You're required to complete the following exercies: 

* **Exercise 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Exercise 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
* **Exercise 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
* **Exercise 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST
* **Exercise 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks
* **Exercise 6:** How to save and load trained models
* **Exercise 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* **Exercise 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats
