## Project Overview
(This project is modified from deep-learning pytorch project from Udacity)

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project ! In this
project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a
web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an
image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s
breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the
resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and
localization, you will make important design decisions about the user
experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you
understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models
designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each
model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world
application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!


## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
    git clone https://github.com/thnguyen996/pytorch-intro.git
	```
2. Navigate to /project_classification/project-dog-classification/
and run the command:
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you
will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of
the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code
that has already been included.__

__NOTE:__ In the notebook, you will need to train CNNs in PyTorch.  If your CNN
is taking too long to train, feel free to use our server gpus to train


## Project Submission

Your submission should consist of the html file converted from the notebook.
You should upload your html file to our Notion page under: **DATES 101 ->
undergraduate interns -> Project -> Dog classification**

## Q&A
We will have Q&A section on this Friday (21/04/16). You could ask questions
there if you have any. Otherwise, feel free to head to Hoang's desk and ask him anytime.
